# IK Solver

An realtime 3 axis IK solver built using Python and cv2.

You can move your mouse on the window and the angles of the arm are then calculated and displayed. The keys W and S also changes the angle of
the joint next the mouse.

The IK is solved using simple trigonmetry and the values and lengths can be adjusted to custom values in the code.
